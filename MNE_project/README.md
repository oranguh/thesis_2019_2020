Some sleepy EEG things

## Getting Started


### Installing

Install MNE https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mne

Install required packages with requirements.txt

Get the data by running: python generate_all_sleepEDF.py

This may take a while. You could generate less data by only downloading a few participants instead of all 19.

## Running the tests

Once you have the data downloaded you can run the model with: python train.py
